Lyricsify is a Python application that uses the [Genius API](https://genius.com/developers) to search for and display song lyrics. It features a simple graphical user interface built with Tkinter and styled with the Spotify color scheme.

## Usage

To use Lyricsify, simply run the `main.py` script in a terminal or command prompt. The graphical user interface will appear, prompting you to enter the name of a song. Once you click the "Search" button, Lyricsify will search for the lyrics to that song using the Genius API and display them in the text box.
